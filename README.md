# Pirate_TreasureHuntGame
CS 370 Project - Intelligence Agent - The Pirate

For this project, I received the initial code for creating the maze environment, setting up the player, and the framework for the intelligent agent. I developed the reinforcement learning aspect, specifically implementing the Deep Q-learning algorithm and training the pirate agent.

Connecting Learning to Computer Science: Computer scientists create and improve algorithms to solve real-world problems and automate complex tasks. This makes the systems more efficient and autonomous. This treasure hunt game project demonstrates how AI can simulate problem-solving approaches like pathfinding and competition.

Approaching Problems as a Computer Scientist: I approached the problem by defining the goal, analyzing the maze layout, and choosing an appropriate algorithm to help the pirate navigate the maze effectively. For the learning process, I iteratively adjusted parameters to balance exploration and exploitation.

Ethical Responsibilities: Computer scientists must ensure that AI systems operate safely and transparently, without biases or behaviors harmful to the user and the organization. It must comply with laws and ensure that users and their data are protected.
